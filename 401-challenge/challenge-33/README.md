# Code challenge 33:

## Hash Table
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
- To Write a function that LEFT JOINs two hashmaps into a single data structure.
   - Arguments: two hash maps
     - The first parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and a synonym of the key as values.
     - The second parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and antonyms of the key as values.
    - Return: The returned data structure that holds the results is up to you. It doesnâ€™t need to exactly match the output below, so long as it achieves the LEFT JOIN logic
