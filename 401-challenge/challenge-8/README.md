# Code challenge 7:

##  linked-list-zip
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
- Linked List is a linear data structure,  linked list elements are not stored at a contiguous location; the elements are linked using pointers.

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
- Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.
-Create a Linked List class include a head property.
- The class should contain the following methods
append,insert before,insert after

### Whiteboard Process

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
- Creating the linkedlist and node class including the methods then testing the result 

- Big O 
   - Time <--- O(2)
   - Space <----- O(1)

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Linked List -->
1. append  method: It will take a value as an argument and return nothing and will adds a new node with that value to the head of the list
2. insert before method: It will take two values as an argument and will adds a new node with the given new value immediately before the first node that has the value specified.
3. insert after method : It will take two values as a parameters and will  adds a new node with the given new value immediately after the first node that has the value specified
